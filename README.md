# Machine-Learning-Proj3-RBF-FF-networks
Project 3 for my machine learning class (CSCI 447). Preprocessor and K-means Clustering __init__ written by Othmane Benaceur. PAM __init__ adapted from k-means __init__. All other code written by me. Includes k-nearest neighbor (with condensed and edited variants), k-means clustering, partitioning around medoids (PAM), radial basis function (RBF) network, and feedforward (FF) network.
Works well, but code will be cleaned up further.
